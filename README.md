# Machine-Learning_Lending-Club

This project takes lending club data downloaded from kaggle as a source for 2 studies for loan predictions. 

Study 1 - Predicting whether a loan applicant's gets approved or denied based on variables in the data. 

Study 2 - Predicting loan default 

Each of these studies are based on some tested machine learning algorithm models to see which has a better predictive rate and what variables/features are most important in predicting the study's outcome. 

# Study 1
All files are in the folder named 'Prediction_and_Analysis_1 - Approved_Denied_Classification'.

Folder content: 

    1- workbook containing the data cleaning and prepping.

    2- Folder named 'Models - approved_Denied' that contains the final data output used in the analysis and model. And a workbook containing the analysis, the models and the rational behind the work.
